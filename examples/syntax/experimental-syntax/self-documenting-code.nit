  /** User Datagram Protocol **
   *  =========================
   *  The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core members
   *  of the Internet Protocol Suite, the set of network protocols
   *  used for the Internet. With UDP, computer applications can
   *  send messages, in this case packets, to other hosts on an
   *  Internet Protocol (IP) network. Prior communications are not
   *  required in order to set up communication channels or data paths.
   *  =================================================================
   *
   *  @srcport:  The source port number.
   *  @dstport:  The destination port number.
   *  @length:   The length of the UDP packet payload in bytes.
   *  @checksum: The checksum of the UDP packet as specified in RFC 768.
   *
   *  @method sync: Update the length and checksum of the UDP packet.
